# Project Overview: "HOTEL DATA ANALYSIS PROJECT"
The objective is to develop a database for analyzing and visualizing hotel booking data. The project includes building a visual data story using Power BI to address key questions for stakeholders.
# Project Requirements or Stakeholders's key questions:
1. Analyze hotel revenue growth by year, segmented by two hotel types.
2. Investigate the need to increase parking lot size by examining trends in guests with personal cars.
3. Explore trends in average daily rate and guest numbers, focusing on seasonality.
# Data Analysis Project Pipeline:

3. Connect Power BI to the database for visualization.
4. Visualize and summarize findings to address stakeholder questions.
# Approach:
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the data. Performed data integration by joining tables to create a unified dataset for import into Power BI. Applied statistical calculations, including mean, sum, and count, to visualize patterns and identify trends. This analysis aims to provide insights for strategic decision-making.
